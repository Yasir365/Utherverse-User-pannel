      <span style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"></span>d. any and all required tax reporting documentation and certification
      that the Company may require in order to satisfy its obligations under applicable laws and regulations;

      shall apply to all generations and issuances of Tokens under this SAFT as and when such Tokens are generated,

      <br>
      <br> (b) <strong><u>Termination Event.</u></strong> If there is a Termination Event before this SAFT expires or

      to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Termination Event. If immediately prior to the consummation of the
      Termination
      Event, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to the Purchaser and all holders of all other
      SAFTs (the <strong>Terminating Purchasers</strong>), as determined in good faith by the Company’s board of

      Generation Event and the delivery
      of the final tranche of Tokens to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(a), and the Purchaser will have no rights to
      any of the assets of the Company or any return of the Purchase Amount after the Token Generation Event or the

      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchaser Representations.</span></strong>
      <br>
      <br> (a) The Purchaser has full legal capacity, power and authority to execute and deliver this SAFT and to
      perform its obligations hereunder. This SAFT constitutes valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser,
      enforceable in accordance with
      its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application relating to or
      affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity.
      <br>
      <br> (b) The Purchaser is eligible to purchase the Right under this SAFT and receive the Tokens under the
      applicable law of the Purchaser’s jurisdiction, including any laws which may apply to virtual currency activities.
      To the extent that
      Purchaser is subject to virtual currency licensure requirements, Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser
      is so licensed and authorized. The Purchaser is purchasing the Right under this SAFT for its own account, not as a
      nominee or
      agent, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof, and the Purchaser has
      no intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same.
      <br>
      <br> (c) The Purchaser understands that there is no guarantee that Tokens will ultimately be minted and
      distributed in a Token Generation Event for any specific price per Token, or at all, that the Platform may never
      launch and/or become functional,
      and that certain licensure and regulatory authorization may never be received to operate the Platform and/or to
      release the Tokens. The Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the
      Purchaser is capable
      of evaluating the merits and risks of entering into this SAFT and of purchasing Tokens and is able to incur a
      complete loss of the Purchase Amount without impairing the Purchaser’s financial condition. The Purchaser further
      represents that
      it has been provided the opportunity to ask the Company questions, and where applicable, has received satisfactory
      answers from the Company, regarding this SAFT, the Whitepaper, and the Tokens generally.

      <br> (d) The Purchaser has sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters, including a
      sufficient understanding of blockchain or cryptographic tokens and other digital assets, smart contracts, storage
      mechanisms (such

      the risks and implications of the Purchaser’s purchase of the Tokens, including but not limited to the matters set
      forth in this
      SAFT, the Whitepaper, and the risks outlined in Section 8, and is able to bear the risks thereof, including loss
      of all amounts paid, loss of Tokens, and liability to the Company and others for its acts and omissions, including
      with limitation
      those constituting breach of this SAFT, negligence, fraud or willful misconduct, and the failure to maintain,
      adhere, and comply with any licensure and/or registration regimes. The Purchaser’s financial situation is such
      that the Purchaser
      can afford to bear the economic risk of holding the Tokens for an indefinite period of time, and the Purchaser can
      afford to suffer the complete loss of the Purchase Price and the Tokens.
      <br>
      <br> (e) The Purchaser understands that the Tokens confer no rights of any form with respect to the Company or any
      related or affiliated entity, including, but not limited to, any ownership, distribution, redemption, liquidation,
      proprietary,
      patent, trademark, or other financial or legal rights.
      <br>
      <br> (f) The Purchaser represents that it has adequate information on which to base its decision to enter into
      this SAFT and purchase Tokens through this SAFT, notwithstanding the fact that the terms of the Token Generation
      Event are not yet
      final and may undergo changes before the date of the Token Generation Event. The Purchaser acknowledges that such
      potential changes may be significant and understands that the terms of the Token Generation Event and any
      applicable use restrictions
      relating thereto will be binding on the Purchaser regardless of the extent, nature or impact of such changes. The
      Purchaser acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the Purchaser should not expect and there is no guarantee or
      representation
      or warranty by the Company that: (a) the use cases of the Platform will remain the same or similar form as
      described in the Whitepaper; and/or (b) the Tokens will have the same or similar use and function as described in
      the Whitepaper. The
      Purchaser acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the Whitepaper may be amended or updated at any time and that
      any such amendment or update, however fundamental, shall not cause the termination of this SAFT.
      <br>

      jurisdiction.
      <br>

      Company or any of its affiliates, employees or agents (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders)
      harmless for any
      claim, liability, assessment or penalty with respect to any taxes (other than any net income taxes of the Company
      that result from the delivery of Tokens to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(a) of the SAFT) associated with or

      Securities Act. The
      Purchaser has been advised that this SAFT is a security that has not been registered under the Securities Act, or
      any state securities laws and, therefore, cannot be resold unless registered under the Securities Act and
      applicable state securities
      laws or unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available. The Purchaser is purchasing this
      SAFT for his, her or its own account for investment, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to, or for
      resale in connection
      with, the distribution thereof, and the Purchaser has no present intention of selling, granting any participation
      in, or otherwise distributing the same. The Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
      matters that
      the Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment, is able to incur a complete loss
      of such investment without impairing the Purchaser’s financial condition, and is able to bear the economic risk of

      where any Tokens are stored, and the Purchaser will not share or disclose the account credentials associated with
      such wallet with
      any other party. If the Purchaser transfers Tokens into another wallet or vault, the Purchaser will likewise at
      all times maintain control of such other wallet or vault, and will not share or disclose the account credentials

      to disqualification nor an event specified in Rule 506(d)(1) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or any other
      securities laws which
      may apply to this SAFT or Company’s related activities. In the event that Purchaser becomes subject to
      disqualification or an event specified in Rule 506(d)(1), or any other applicable disqualification, at any date at
      or after this SAFT is
      executed, Purchaser agrees to provide documentation and participate in remedies as necessary to ensure that
      Purchasers’ change in status does not negatively impact Company’s ongoing and/or future reliance on any applicable
      registration, exemption,
      and/or other offering.
      <br>
      <br> (aa) The Purchaser agrees that the representations contained in this Section 4 shall be deemed to be repeated
      on each date on which Tokens are issued to the Purchaser or any wallet or custody account in the Purchaser’s
      control, including
      the issuance or delivery of any subset of the Tokens, and any delivery or vesting of Tokens relating to any
      vesting schedule applicable to this SAFT. The Purchaser understands and agrees that the Company shall be under no
      obligation to issue
      any Tokens to the Purchaser in the event that any representation contained in this Section 4 is inaccurate or
      misleading in any way on the date such representation is made or deemed to be made.
      <br>
      <br> (bb) The Purchaser understands and agrees that until such time as Tokens are delivered under the terms of
      Section 1(a), released pursuant to the Release Schedule, and transferred into the Purchaser’s control and custody,
      any and all rewards,
      staking payments, on-chain benefits, air-drops, and or any other reward, interest, payment, sum, or benefit
      received from the control, custody, and hosting of the Tokens shall belong to Company. The Purchaser further
      agrees, warrants, and
      represents that the Purchaser takes no interest and makes no claim in any such reward, staking payment, on-chain
      benefit, air-drop, and or any other reward, interest, payment, sum, or benefit received from the control, custody,
      and hosting
      of the Tokens by Company.
      <br>
      <br> (cc) The Purchaser understands and agrees that Token release terms, timelines, and schedules, including those
      contained in the Release Schedule, are subject to change and may be modified by the Company at any time, in the
      Company’s sole
      discretion. The Purchaser understands and agrees that such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes
      necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations, future regulatory changes, regulatory oversight,
      regulatory examination,
      registration, and licensure requirements, which may include limitations on the Purchaser’s ability to transact,
      sell, self-host, self-custody, control, pledge, stake, or otherwise freely transact or encumber the Tokens.
      <br>
      <br> (dd) The Purchaser understands and agrees that the cross-chain and multi-chain nature of the Tokens may
      increase certain on-chain, third-party, and decentralized computing risks discussed in Section 8, including, but
      not limited to validation
      attack risks defined in Section 8 (b). The Purchaser further agrees and warrants that the Purchaser understands
      that validation and validation procedures applicable to the network or networks and blockchain or blockchains upon
      which the Token
      may be designed, function, or operate, may be outside the control of Company, may be decentralized, or may be
      controlled by third parties.
      <br>
      <br> No reference in this SAFT to any securities law, applicable regulatory regime, nor any representation,
      warranty, nor any other reference made herein should be construed as indicating any conclusion that the Tokens are
      “securities” within
      the meaning of the Securities Act or other applicable laws.
      <br>
      <br> THE PURCHASER IS AWARE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASING, OWNING AND USING TOKENS INCLUDING THE
      INHERENT RISK OF THE POTENTIAL TO LOSE ALL AMOUNTS PAID FOR TOKENS.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span></span>SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, THE PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS THAT PURCHASER HAS NO RIGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY
      OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF THE COMPANY'S BREACH OF THIS SAFT, INTENTIONAL FRAUD OR AS
      OTHERWISE EXPLICITLY
      SET OUT HEREIN. THE COMPANY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS SAFT, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF
      OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL OF PURCHASE AMOUNT PURSUANT TO
      THIS SAFT. NEITHER
      THE COMPANY NOR ITS ADVISORS NOR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
      EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE, ARISING OUT OF OR
      RELATING TO ANY
      BREACH OF THIS SAFT EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <span style="margin-left: 3rem;">(a)</span> Use Restrictions. Until such time as the Platform is launched and
      applicable services relating thereto are launched, licensed, and certified applying to the use of the Token on the
      Platform, the
      Token will be subject to certain use restrictions including general prohibitions on the Purchaser’s ability to
      sell, transfer, spend, exchange or otherwise make use of the Tokens on any network, protocol, exchange, or other
      platform.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span></span>The Purchaser acknowledges and is aware that the Tokens delivered pursuant to this SAFT are subject
      to certain use restriction until such time as the Platform is launched and the applicable services relating
      thereto are launched,
      licensed, and certified applying to the use of the Token on the Platform. Token delivery dates and any applicable
      vesting schedule relating to this SAFT may include delivery and vesting events prior to the functionality of the
      Platform and
      the licensing of services. Tokens may not be available for sale, exchange, or listing on certain exchanges, other
      platforms, or other services prior to Platform launch.

      <br>
      <br>
      <span></span>The Purchaser acknowledges and is aware that certain custody limitations, release schedules, and
      other restrictions may apply to the Tokens prior to the launch of the Platform. The Purchaser acknowledges and is
      aware that any
      such use restrictions may apply to vested, delivered, and/or minted Tokens and may include restrictions
      prohibiting self-custody and other wallet and hosting mechanisms.

      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="margin-left: 3rem;">(b)</span> Restrictions on Transfer. The Purchaser acknowledges and is aware that
      there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the SAFT and the Tokens, and there will be no public
      market for
      the SAFT and the Tokens for U.S. Purchasers. The SAFT and the Tokens will not be registered under the Securities
      Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the
      registration
      requirements. This means that holders of the SAFT and the Tokens may not transfer the SAFT or the Tokens to any
      “U.S. Person,” within the meaning of Rule 902(a)(k) under the Securities Act or to any Canadian person to whom
      transfer may be
      prohibited pursuant to applicable Canadian securities laws.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span></span>The Purchaser acknowledges and is aware that any transfer made in violation of the transfer
      provisions of the SAFT will be void.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="margin-left: 3rem;">(c)</span> Regulatory Issues. The sale of Tokens under this SAFT could subject
      the Company to certain legal requirements, which could be significant. Regulation, regulatory changes, and
      regulatory developments
      could lead to changes and outcomes described herein and any of these outcomes may negatively affect the value of
      the Tokens and/or cause the Company to cease operations.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span></span>The Purchaser acknowledges and understands that the SAFT and the Tokens are not registered with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission, and that the Company is not registered or licensed with any U.S. federal or
      state regulator
      as an investment adviser, broker-dealer, money services business, money transmitter, or virtual currency business.
      As a result, the Purchaser will not be afforded the full set of protections provided to the clients and customers
      of such entities
      under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
      amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and any
      similar or applicable
      state laws.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span></span>The SAFT is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are
      not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(d)</span> Waiver of Certain Privacy Rights. The Purchaser certifies that the
      Purchaser has completed and submitted any required waiver of local privacy laws that could otherwise prevent
      disclosure of information
      by the Company to any required regulatory body, governing agency and/or pursuant to any laws, regulations, or
      reporting requirements to which the Company may be subject, including without limitation any applicable national,
      international,
      and intergovernmental reporting requirements and regulations applicable to tax, anti-money laundering, combatting
      the funding of terrorism, bank secrecy, and other applicable regimes.

      <span></span><strong>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Disclaimers
        </span></strong>
      <br>
      <br> (a) The Purchaser assumes full responsibility and liability for any losses resulting from any intentional or
      unintentional misuse of the Purchaser’s wallet including, without limitation, the loss of the Purchaser’s private
      keys associated
      with the wallet, any loss resulting from designating a non-Token compliant wallet for the receipt of the Tokens,
      depositing one type of digital asset to a wallet intended for another type of digital wallet, failing to properly
      maintain the
      wallet, or any third party gaining access to the wallet and misappropriating the Tokens. The Company assumes no
      responsibility or liability in connection with any such misuse by the Purchaser or any third party or any loss of
      the Purchaser’s
      private keys associated with the wallet.
      <br>
      <br> (b) Except as expressly provided by this SAFT and applicable laws, the Company shall not be responsible or
      liable for any losses resulting directly or indirectly from: (i) government restrictions; exchange, regulatory, or
      market rulings;
      suspension of trading; military operations; terrorist activity; strikes, or any other condition beyond the
      Company’s control, including without limitation extreme market volatility or trading volume; (ii) Purchaser’s
      failure to adhere to use
      restrictions applicable to delivered or vested Tokens, or (iii) any action taken by Company to comply with
      applicable laws or this SAFT.
      <br>
      <br> (c) Neither the Company nor any subsidiary thereof are currently supervised any regulator in any
      jurisdiction.
      <br>
      <br> (d) The purchase of the Tokens: (a) does not provide the Purchaser with rights of any form with respect to
      the Company or its revenues or assets, including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption,
      liquidation, proprietary
      (including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights; (b) is not a loan to the
      Company; (c) does not provide the Purchaser with any priority, access, and/or seniority with respect to any future
      offering, token
      sale, and/or Platform access, and (d) does not provide the Purchaser with any ownership or other interest in the
      Company.
      <br>
      <br> (e) THE COMPANY’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SAFT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PURCHASE AMOUNT AND IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
      COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, CONTROLLING PERSONS, SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS BE LIABLE TO
      PURCHASER OR
      ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES OF
      ANY KIND FOR LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, TRADING LOSSES, INACCURATE DISTRIBUTIONS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR DATA, EVEN IF
      ADVISED OF
      THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT,
      TORT OR OTHERWISE.
      <br>
      <br> (f) THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE PURCHASER, AND THE PURCHASER WILL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD
      HARMLESS THE COMPANY AND ITS AGENTS AND ADVISORS, AND THE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OF THE FOREGOING, FROM AND
      AGAINST, ALL OR ANY PART

      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="margin-left: 3rem;"></span> (a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser understands the
      meaning and legal consequences of the representations and warranties contained in this SAFT, and hereby agrees to
      indemnify and
      hold harmless the Company, and each other person, if any, who controls, is controlled by, or is under common
      control with any of the foregoing (Indemnified Persons) from and against any and all loss, claim, damage,
      liability or expense whatsoever
      (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) due to or arising out of or based upon (i) any inaccurate
      representation or warranty made by the Purchaser, or breach or failure by the Purchaser to comply with any
      covenant or agreement
      made by the Purchaser in this SAFT (including any related questionnaires, forms, of information submitted to the
      Company relating to this SAFT, the release or delivery of any Tokens, and/or to agreements relating thereto) or in
      any other document
      furnished by the Purchaser to any of Indemnified Persons in connection with this transaction, (ii) any action for
      securities, commodities, virtual currency services, and/or money transmission law violations instituted by the
      Purchaser that
      is finally resolved by judgment against the Purchaser, or (iii) any action instituted by or on behalf of the
      Purchaser against Indemnified Persons, that is finally resolved by judgment against the Purchaser or in favor of
      Indemnified Persons.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risks.</span></strong>
      <br>
      <br> The Purchaser has carefully reviewed, acknowledges, understands, and assumes the following risks, as well as
      all other risks associated with the Tokens (including those not discussed herein), all of which could render the
      Tokens worthless
      or of little value:
      <br>
      <br> (a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risks Associated with the Protocol. </span>Any malfunction,
      breakdown, or abandonment of the protocol on which the Tokens are based may have a material adverse effect on the
      Tokens. Advances
      in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the
      Tokens by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the protocol.
      <br>
      <br> (b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risk of Validators Attacks. </span>The Tokens are susceptible
      to attacks by validators in the course of validating the Tokens' transactions on the blockchain, including, but
      not limited,
      to double-spend attacks, majority validator power attacks, and selfish-validator attacks. Any successful attacks
      present a risk to the Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions
      involving the Tokens.
      These risks may be magnified to the extent that the Tokens are dependent on external, third-party, and/or
      decentralized validation methods and by cross-chain Token hosting and usage.
      <br>
      <br> (c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risks that Technology May be Superseded. </span>There is no
      guarantee that the blockchain and other technology upon which the Platform is built will not be supplanted by
      competing protocols
      or superior computing or ledger and validation mechanisms. The technology underlying the Tokens may be open
      source, meaning that anyone can copy and disseminate the same code with modifications. If the blockchain
      technology underpinning the
      Tokens is surpassed or superseded, then this could impact the Token program as usage and adoption declines.
      <br>
      <br> (d) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risks related to the Ability to Transact or Resell. </span>
      The Purchaser may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in Tokens at any time, with certain counterparties,
      using certain intermediaries,
      or for the price originally paid. By purchasing the Tokens, the Purchaser acknowledges, understands and agrees
      that: (a) the Tokens may have no value; (b) Purchaser may lose all amounts paid; (c) there is no guarantee or
      representation of
      liquidity for the Tokens; and (d) the Company is not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market
      value of the Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of the Tokens and/or the availability of any market for
      the Tokens through
      third parties or otherwise.
      <br>
      <br> (e) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Source Code Risks.</span> The source code underpinning the
      Tokens and the Platform may contain flaws, bugs, defects, or inconsistencies that could compromise the
      predictability, usability,
      functionality, stability, and security of the Tokens. The Company will attempt to perform quality assurance and
      audit procedures to ensure the source code accurately reflects the Tokens' intended operation, though there can be
      no guarantee
      that any errors are identified, or the source code will be error-free. In addition, source code modifications or
      updates may lead to unexpected or unintended outcomes that may adversely affect the utility or functionality of
      the Tokens or
      any associated services. Source code modifications that constitute upgrades may be required in connection with the
      development of the Tokens or associated services, and your failure to participate in any such upgrades may result
      in the loss
      of some or all Token functionality.
      <br>
      <br> (f) <span style="text-decoration: underline ;">Risk of Hacking and Security Weakness.</span> The Tokens may
      be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
      interfere with the
      Platform, or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service
      attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Platform may
      rest in part on
      open-source software and the Tokens may be based on open-source software, there is the risk that smart contracts
      used on the Platform in connection with the Tokens may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses
      which may negatively
      affect the Tokens or result in the loss of the Tokens, the loss of the Purchaser's ability to access or control
      his Tokens or the loss of other crypto assets in his account. In the event of such a software bug or weakness,
      there may be no
      remedy and holders of the Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund, or compensation.
      <br>
      <br> (g) <span style="text-decoration: underline ;">Risk of Losing Access to the Tokens Due to Loss of Private
        Key(s).</span> The Tokens purchased by the Purchaser may be held in a digital wallet or vault, which requires a
      private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s)
      associated with his digital
      wallet or vault storing the Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens and/or access to his Token balance.
      Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login
      credentials of a hosted wallet
      or vault service the Purchaser uses, may be able to misappropriate his Tokens. The Company is not responsible for
      any such losses.
      <br>
      <br> (h) <span style="text-decoration: underline ;">Risk of Invalid Wallet.</span> It is the Purchaser’s
      responsibility to ensure that the digital wallet address provided to the Company for the receipt of the Tokens is
      capable of accepting
      all types and categories of tokens, including tokens. The Company is not responsible if the Purchaser’s wallet is
      not capable of accepting the Tokens distributed by the Company. The Purchaser assumes all responsibility with
      respect to the
      foregoing, and the Company accepts no liability whatsoever for wallets that do not accept the Tokens distributed
      by the Company.
      <br>
      <br> (i) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risks Associated with Markets for the Tokens.</span> The Tokens
      are intended to be used solely in connection with the Platform, and the Company will not support or otherwise
      facilitate any
      secondary trading or external valuation of the Tokens. This restricts the possible avenues for using the Tokens
      and could therefore create liquidity risk with respect to the Tokens the Purchaser holds. Even if secondary
      trading of the Tokens
      is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no
      regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third
      parties do ascribe
      an external exchange value to the Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be
      extremely volatile and diminish to zero.
      <br>
      <br> (j) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Uninsured Losses.</span> Unlike bank accounts or
      accounts at financial institutions, the Tokens are uninsured unless the Purchaser specifically obtains private
      insurance to insure
      them. In the event of loss or loss of utility value, Token access, Token usage, wallet access, or protocol
      failure, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by the Company to offer recourse to the
      Purchaser. Tokens are not
      payment instruments, deposits, or legal tender, and are not backed by any government. Token-related accounts and
      value balances are not subject to consumer, governmental, and/or other protections.
      <br>
      <br> (k) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulatory Framework.</span>
      The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in
      many jurisdictions.
      It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise
      difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations
      and/or rules that
      will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could
      negatively impact the Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that the Tokens are
      regulated financial
      instruments that require registration. The Company may cease the distribution of the Tokens or cease operations in
      a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to
      do so. Applicable
      Token use restrictions and other Token limitations are subject to change.
      <br>
      <br> (l) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risks of Government Action.</span> The industry in which the
      Company operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or
      enforcement actions.
      There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of the Company and/or
      pursue enforcement actions against the Company. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of
      targeting
      the Company in particular. All of this may subject the Company to judgments, settlements, fines, or penalties, or
      cause the Company to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services,
      all of which
      could harm the Company’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse
      effect on the Tokens.
      <br>
      <br> (m) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risks Arising from Taxation.</span> The tax characterization
      of the Tokens is uncertain. The Purchaser must seek his own tax advice in connection with purchasing the Tokens,
      which may result
      in adverse tax consequences to him, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
      <br>
      <br> (n) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Alternative Platform.</span> It is possible that
      alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same code and/or protocols underlying the Platform and
      attempt to facilitate
      services that are materially similar to the services provided by the Platform. The Platform may compete with these
      alternative platforms, which could negatively impact the Platform and the Tokens.
      <br>
      <br> (o) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Platform.</span> It is
      possible that the Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that
      there will be
      limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Platform) more
      generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Platform and therefore
      the potential utility
      of the Tokens.
      <br>
      <br> (p) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the
        Platform. </span>The Platform may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the Tokens and
      the Platform to follow the specifications set forth in the Whitepaper, and will take commercially reasonable steps
      toward those ends,
      we may have to make changes to the specifications of the Tokens or the Platform for any number of legitimate
      reasons. This could create the risk that the Tokens or the Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not
      meet your expectations
      at the time of purchasing the Tokens. Furthermore, despite our good-faith efforts to develop and maintain the
      Platform, it is still possible that the Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately
      developed or maintained,
      which may negatively impact the Platform and the potential utility of the Tokens.
      <br>
      <br> (q) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Risk of Dissolution of the Company.</span> It is possible
      that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of
      crypto assets (or other
      cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’ utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or
      intellectual property ownership challenges, the Platform may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may be
      dissolved.
      <br>
      <br> (r) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legal Risks.</span> Local and international laws, regulations
      and/or rules applicable to technology industries, including but not limited to those regarding the blockchain
      technology, digital
      assets, platform systems, and digital tokens may impact or constrain the design, implementation and operation of
      the Platform and any related tokens, digital assets, payment systems, services, and other mechanisms relating
      thereto.
      <br>
      <br> (s) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unanticipated Risks.</span> Cryptographic tokens such as the
      Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Section 8, there are other
      risks associated
      with the purchase, holding and use of the Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks
      may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Section 8.

      <br> (a) This SAFT is one of a series of SAFTs being sold by the Company from time to time (collectively,
      <strong>SAFTs</strong>). Any provision of this SAFT may be amended, waived or modified only upon the written
      consent of the Company and the holders of a majority in aggregate purchase amount paid to the Company with respect
      to all outstanding
      SAFTs at the time of such amendment, waiver or modification.
      <br>
      <br> (b) This SAFT sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter
      herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous disclosures, discussions, understandings and agreements,
      whether oral or
      written, between them relating to the subject matter hereof.
      <br>
      <br> (c) Any notice required or permitted by this SAFT will be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by
      overnight courier or sent by email to the relevant address listed on the signature page, as the same may be
      subsequently modified
      by written notice.
      <br>
      <br> (d) Neither this SAFT nor the rights contained herein may be assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by
      either party without the prior written consent of the other; provided, that the Company may assign or novate this
      SAFT in whole
      in connection with (a) a reincorporation to change the Company’s domicile or (b) a novation to a Person other than
      the Company who will issue Tokens in satisfaction of the Company's obligations hereunder (and the Purchaser hereby
      irrevocably
      consents to such novation and agrees and undertakes to execute any and all documentation that the Company shall
      deem necessary in connection with such novation).
      <br>
      <br> (e) The terms of this SAFT shall survive the acceptance of Purchaser’s Token application and the initial
      issuances of Tokens to the Purchaser where Tokens are issued using a schedule or subject to any sub-issuance by
      Company.
      <br>
      <br> (f) In the event any one or more of the provisions of this SAFT is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal
      or unenforceable, in whole or in part or in any respect, or in the event that any one or more of the provisions of
      this SAFT
      operate or would prospectively operate to invalidate this SAFT, then and in any such event, such provision(s) only
      will be deemed null and void and will not affect any other provision of this SAFT and the remaining provisions of
      this SAFT
      will remain operative and in full force and effect and will not be affected, prejudiced, or disturbed thereby.
      <br>
      <br> (g) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents,
      instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such further actions as may be reasonably requested by Company to
      carry out the
      provisions of this SAFT and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this SAFT, including, without
      limitation, to enable the Company or the transactions contemplated by this SAFT to comply with applicable laws.
      <br>
      <br> (h) Nothing in this SAFT and no action taken by the parties pursuant to this SAFT shall constitute, or be
      deemed to constitute, a partnership, association, joint venture or other cooperative entity between any of the
      parties. Nothing
      in this SAFT and no action taken by the parties pursuant to this SAFT shall constitute, or be deemed to
      constitute, either party the agent of the other party for any purpose. No party has, pursuant to this SAFT, any
      authority or power to bind
      or to contract in the name of the other party.
      <br>
      <br> (i) The Purchaser acknowledges that the Company may add new terms or policies to or regarding the Tokens in
      its sole and absolute discretion, and may update each of such terms from time to time. In the event of any
      conflict between this
      SAFT and such terms, those terms shall prevail. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall be Purchaser's
      responsibility to regularly check the Platform's website for any notices of any such change or modification.
      <br>
      <br> (j) This SAFT may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
      which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
      <br>
      <br> (k) This SAFT shall be governed in all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the
      laws of the British Virgin Islands, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws.
      <br>
      <br> (l) The Company and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim
      arising out of, relating to or in connection with this instrument (a <strong>Dispute</strong>). If the parties are
      unable to resolve
      a Dispute within ninety (90) days of written notice of such Dispute being received by all parties, such Dispute
      shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules.
      <br>
      <br> (m) The number of arbitrators shall be three.
      <br>
      <br> (n) The place of arbitration shall be Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands.
      <br>
      <br> (o) The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.
